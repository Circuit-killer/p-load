Pololu USB Bootloader Utility (p-load) for Mac OS X

The Pololu USB Bootloader Utility is a command-line program that
allows you to read and write from the memories of certain Pololu
products over USB using their USB bootloaders.

To install, drag "p-load" to "usrlocalbin".  This will install p-load
in /usr/local/bin so you can run it in a Terminal by typing "p-load".
Because /usr/local/bin is protected, you might need to enter an
administrator password.

To get a help screen showing the available command-line arguments,
just run "p-load" in a Terminal with no arguments.

The source code of the utility is available online at:
